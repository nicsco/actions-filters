actions-filters
===============

A tiny PHP library that allow anyone to implement ACTIONS and FILTERS, in a WordPress-like way.

Actions and Filters are a way to call functions, or methods in a selected point of the code, without having to set in that moment what functions have to be called.

The functions are linked to a tag (with add_filter and add_action) and later only the tag needs to be called (apply_filter and apply_action). The difference is that a FILTER is mean to apply functions that can change a particular value, while an ACTION does not.


Feel free to use and or change this in any way you like.
